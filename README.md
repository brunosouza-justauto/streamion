## Requirements ##

### Software Requirements ###

This Ruby on Rails app is only one part of Streamion and is in need of other components to work. Streamion currently needs the following to work properly:

- [NGINX-based Media Streaming Server](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module)
- [JWPlayer](http://www.jwplayer.com)

We are working on support for other streaming server solutions as well as support for other video players.

### Hardware Requirements ###

Since live streaming and streaming in general is consuming a lot of bandwidth and traffic there are some things you should be aware of, please read our documentation for that.
